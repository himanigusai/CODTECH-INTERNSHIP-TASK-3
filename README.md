DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4:

🎧 Redesigned Spotify Mobile App – Fresh Look, Smoother Experience 🎧

I’ve redesigned the Spotify mobile app with a modern, user-friendly interface that enhances the overall listening experience. Here's what I focused on:

🔸 Modern UI/UX:
A clean, sleek design with improved layout and typography for better readability and navigation.

🔸 Enhance landing page:
On the first page of the application, I decided to open with ‘Get Started’ page for people to get to know small information about Spotify. Users can log in from other application accounts or create their own Spotify account.

🔸 Home page:
The homepage is the first impression that influences users to continue using this app, so it needs to be more interesting and tidy. I decide to recommend new popular songs on top of the homepage based on the user’s top 5 favorite artists or song genres.

I added more sections that will be an important part for easier access, users can access the newest song, followed and recommended artists, or even podcasts. In the next part, users can swipe left or right to change to ‘Recently Played’ or ‘Playlists’ which can pin on the homepage.

These could make the homepage simple, shorter, and easier to scroll.



🔸 Improved Search page:
On the search page, I created 2 new features for better experiences.

 1.The first one is a combination of GPS and Spotify, users can discover new music surrounding them without searching. Spotify users will easily find new various music in just one click.
 
 2. Another one is searching for an unknown song by singing or humming, and then it will show the lists of similar songs.


🔸 User-Centered Design:
Simplified icons, smoother transitions, and easy discoverability of new music and podcasts.



📱 This redesign was done with the goal of improving usability, accessibility, and visual appeal, while staying true to Spotify’s brand identity.
